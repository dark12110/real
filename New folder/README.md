# Atmosphere Attire Advisor (A3) Algorithm

## Project Overview

The Atmosphere Attire Advisor (A3) is an AI-powered clothing recommendation system designed to suggest outfits based on weather conditions and social occasions. The algorithm aims to reduce outfit selection time by 60% (from 17 minutes to 7 minutes) and increase wardrobe utilization by 40%, while maintaining a user satisfaction rate of at least 90%.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the complete algorithm design, implementation, optimization strategies, and documentation for the A3 system:

## Key Features

- **Image-based clothing classification**: Automatically categorizes clothing items using ResNet50
- **Weather-sensitive recommendations**: Adapts to current and forecasted weather conditions
- **Occasion-based suggestions**: Provides appropriate outfits for different social contexts
- **Wardrobe utilization optimization**: Ensures balanced use of available clothing items
- **Personalized recommendations**: Learns from user preferences and feedback

## System Architecture

The A3 algorithm consists of five main components:

1. **Image Classification Module**: Processes clothing item images using ResNet50
2. **Weather Integration Module**: Fetches and analyzes weather data
3. **Occasion Analyzer Module**: Determines clothing requirements based on events
4. **Recommendation Engine**: Generates outfit combinations
5. **Wardrobe Utilization Optimizer**: Balances item usage over time

## Implementation

The algorithm is implemented in Python using TensorFlow/Keras for machine learning components. The implementation includes:

- Pre-trained ResNet50 model for clothing classification
- Decision tree algorithms for weather classification
- K-means clustering for color analysis
- Collaborative filtering for personalization
- Hierarchical outfit generation for efficiency

## Optimization

The algorithm includes several optimization techniques:

- **Performance**: Batch processing, model quantization, feature caching
- **Accuracy**: Fine-tuning with fashion datasets, ensemble classification, advanced color analysis
- **Mobile**: Progressive loading, on-device model optimization, local caching
- **User Experience**: Continuous learning from feedback, A/B testing, recommendation explanations
